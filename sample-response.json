Please review the resume writing and interviewing tips provided below to help prepare you for your next career opportunity. Getting started Regardless of the position you are interested in, the starting points to building your resume are the same: 1. Determine the job or types of jobs you want to do and research their responsibilities and qualifications. 2. Think about why you can do the job and make a list of your skills that are relative to the job. 3. Identify experiences or accomplishments that show your proficiency in the skills required for the job. 4. Summarize your abilities, accomplishments and skills into a brief, concise document. Considerations when writing a resume • Do be brief. Resumes should be 1-2 pages in length. • Do be upbeat and active in your wording. • Do emphasize what you have done clearly and concretely. • Do be neat and well organized. • Do have others proofread and critique your resume. Spell check. Make it error free. • Do use high quality, white or light colored 8½ x 11 paper. Use a laser printer if possible. • Don't be dishonest, always tell the truth about yourself in the most flattering light. • Don't include salary history or requirements. • Don't include references. • Don't include accomplishments that do not support your professional goals. • Don't include anything that isn't relevant. (For example, don't mention your fondness for swimming unless you want to work on the water.) • Don't use italics, underlining, shadows or other fancy treatments. Seven steps to a successful interview 1. Anticipate –Put yourself in the interviewer's position. What do you believe the interviewer is most interested in? Why do you think you have been invited to interview? 2. Research –What are the primary functions of the line of business? What are the success factors for the job? Is there a job description available? 3. Assess –Think about your skills, abilities, knowledge, interests, traits, values and accomplishments. Match them to what you know about the job. Consider which ones you should highlight. 4. Prepare Answers –Think about what the interviewer may ask, determine what the best answer is and write it down. 5. Prepare Questions – Interviewing is a two-way street. By asking thoughtful questions, you communicate your interest and learn a lot about the job. Choose two or three questions to ask your interviewer. Avoid asking a lot of questions about vacation time or breaks. 6. Practice – It may seem awkward, but it is the best way to come across well in an interview. Practice your own \"great responses\" with others or in front of a mirror until you appear relaxed and at ease. 7. Follow-up – Send a brief follow-up letter to the interviewer. Keep in mind that the many job searchers will not send a follow-up letter. Sending one can become a competitive advantage.
