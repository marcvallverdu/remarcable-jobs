# FindOperators - Data Point Prioritization Plan

## Overview
This plan prioritizes data points based on their impact on operator decision-making. Each tier represents a milestone in profile richness, with P0 being the absolute minimum viable profile.

## Priority Framework

**Prioritization Criteria:**
1. **Decision Impact**: How much does this influence an operator's decision to engage?
2. **Differentiation**: Does this set us apart from traditional job boards?
3. **Availability**: Can we realistically obtain this data?
4. **Trust Building**: Does this build credibility with senior operators?

## Data Coverage Strategy

### Minimum Coverage Rules
- Never publish a profile below P0 completion (100% of P0 fields)
- Aim for 80% completion of P1 fields before featuring
- Mark profiles with coverage level (Essential/Enhanced/Premium)

### Quality Over Quantity
- Better to have 20 exceptional profiles than 200 basic ones
- Focus on companies that truly need operators
- Prioritize freshness for key fields (funding, headcount, open roles)

### Progressive Enhancement
- Start with P0 for all companies
- Identify high-value companies for P1 enhancement
- Select showcase companies for P2+ treatment
- Use engagement metrics to guide enhancement priorities
