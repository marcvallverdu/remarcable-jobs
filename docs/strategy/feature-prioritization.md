# FindOperators - Feature Prioritization Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines the feature roadmap from MVP to full vision, prioritized by impact on operator experience and business differentiation. Each phase builds toward positioning FindOperators as THE platform for operator-level opportunities.

## Prioritization Framework

**Features are prioritized based on:**

2. **Differentiation**: Does this set us apart from LinkedIn/Indeed/etc?
3. **Feasibility**: Can we build this with available resources?
4. **Business Impact**: Does this drive operator engagement and company participation?
