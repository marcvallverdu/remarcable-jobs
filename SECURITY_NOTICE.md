# ðŸ”’ Security Notice

## Important: Database Credentials

**NEVER commit database credentials or API keys to the repository!**

### Immediate Actions Required:

1. **Rotate Your Database Password**
   - Go to your Neon dashboard: https://console.neon.tech
   - Navigate to your database settings
   - Generate a new password immediately
   - Update the password in your Vercel environment variables

2. **Update Environment Variables**
   - Go to Vercel dashboard > Settings > Environment Variables
   - Update the DATABASE_URL with the new password
   - Redeploy your application

### Best Practices:

1. **Never commit sensitive data:**
   - Database URLs with passwords
   - API keys
   - Authentication secrets
   - Private keys or certificates

2. **Use environment variables:**
   - Store all secrets in `.env` files (which are gitignored)
   - Use hosting platform's environment variable management
   - Never hardcode credentials in documentation

3. **For documentation:**
   - Use placeholders like `[your-database-url]`
   - Reference where to find the actual values
   - Provide examples without real credentials

4. **Git history:**
   - If credentials were previously committed, they remain in git history
   - Consider using tools like BFG Repo-Cleaner to remove them
   - Always rotate credentials after exposure

### Secure Configuration Example:

```bash
# .env.production (never commit this file)
DATABASE_URL="[copy-from-neon-dashboard]"
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET="[generate-with-openssl]"
```

### Generate Secure Secrets:

```bash
# Generate auth secret
openssl rand -base64 32

# Generate API key
openssl rand -hex 32
```

### Check for Exposed Secrets:

```bash
# Search for potential secrets in your repo
git grep -E "(password|secret|key|token)" --no-index
```

## Remember:
- Credentials in git history are permanently exposed
- Always rotate credentials after any exposure
- Use secret scanning tools in your CI/CD pipeline
- Enable GitHub secret scanning if using GitHub
